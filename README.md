## 🌱 ESP32 Smart Farming Monitor

The **ESP32 Smart Farming Monitor** is an IoT-based project designed to automate and monitor key environmental conditions for plant growth. It uses an ESP32 microcontroller to read **soil moisture**, **temperature**, and **humidity** data, displaying real-time values on a responsive web interface. The system intelligently controls a **water pump** using a **relay module** based on soil moisture percentage, ensuring plants are watered only when needed.

### 🚀 Features

* 📶 **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: ESP32 connects to your local Wi-Fi to serve live sensor data on a web page.
* 🌡️ **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring**: Uses DHT11 sensor to monitor environmental conditions.
* 🌾 **Soil Moisture Analysis**: Converts analog values from YL-69 sensor to percentage-based readings.
* 💧 **Automatic Water Pump Control**: Activates pump via a relay module when moisture falls below a threshold.
* 🌐 **Live Web Dashboard**: Displays current readings with a clean, mobile-friendly UI.

### 🔌 Hardware Used

* ESP32 Dev Module
* DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
* YL-69 Soil Moisture Sensor
* Relay Module (1-channel)
* 5V DC Water Pump
* Jumper Wires, Breadboard/PCB, Power Supply

### 🧠 How It Works

1. The ESP32 reads sensor data every 2 seconds.
2. It maps soil moisture from raw ADC (0–4095) to percentage (0–100%).
3. If soil moisture drops below the set threshold (e.g., 40%), the relay turns ON the pump.
4. The device hosts a live dashboard accessible via browser on the local network.
